## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" width="550" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation (current)

The undo/redo mechanism is implemented via `VersionedAddressBook`, which maintains two stacks:
- `addressBookStateHistory` (undo stack)
- `addressBookRedoHistory` (redo stack)

APIs:
- `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` saves a copy of the current state to the undo stack and clears the redo stack.
- `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` pushes the current state onto the redo stack, pops the previous state from the undo stack, and calls `resetData(previousState)`.
- `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` pushes the current state onto the undo stack, pops from the redo stack, and calls `resetData(nextState)`.

Model surface:
- `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()`, `Model#redo()` delegate to the above `VersionedAddressBook` methods.
- On successful `undo()`/`redo()`, `ModelManager` refreshes filtered lists via `updateFilteredPersonList`, `updateFilteredEventList`, and `updateFilteredTaskList` to keep the UI consistent.

Supported commands:
All commands that modify data are undoable, including:
- Member operations: `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `clear`
- Event operations: `addevent`, `deleteevent`, `setexpense`
- Task operations: `addtask`, `deletetask`, `marktask`, `unmarktask`
- Attendance operations: `addattendance`, `markattendance`, `unmarkattendance`, `removeAttendees`
- Budget operations: `budgetset`, `budgetreset`

Read-only commands (like `list`, `find`, `showattendance`, `viewattendees`, `budgetreport`) do not commit state and cannot be undone.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" width="400" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" width="400" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" width="400" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not save state, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`. All modifying commands automatically commit state before execution (including attendance operations: `addattendance`, `markattendance`, `unmarkattendance`, `removeAttendees`), making them undoable.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" width="400" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the undo stack is empty, `undo()` returns false and no state change occurs. Similarly, if the redo stack is empty, `redo()` returns false.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" width="550" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" width="550" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command calls `Model#redo()`, restoring the next state if available.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" width="450" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" width="450" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="450" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Add member feature

The add member feature allows users to add new members to the address book with their details.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for adding a member:

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `add` command works:
1. When the user enters an `add` command, `LogicManager` passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
2. `AddressBookParser` creates an `AddCommandParser` to parse the command arguments.
3. `AddCommandParser` validates and parses all required fields (name, year, student number, email, phone, dietary requirements, role, and optional tags).
4. An `AddCommand` object is created and executed.
5. Before execution, the current state is committed for undo/redo functionality.
6. `AddCommand` checks if a person with the same student number already exists.
7. If not duplicate, the person is added to the address book.
8. The updated address book is saved to storage.

### Edit member feature

The edit member feature allows users to update existing member details.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for editing a member:

<puml src="diagrams/EditSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `EditCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `edit` command works:
1. When the user enters an `edit` command with an index and field updates, `LogicManager` passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
2. `AddressBookParser` creates an `EditCommandParser` to parse the command arguments.
3. `EditCommandParser` validates the index and parses the optional fields to update.
4. An `EditCommand` object is created with an `EditPersonDescriptor` containing the updates.
5. Before execution, the current state is committed for undo/redo functionality.
6. `EditCommand` retrieves the person at the specified index from the filtered list.
7. A new `Person` object is created with the updated fields.
8. `EditCommand` checks if the edited person already exists (unless it's the same person).
9. If valid, the person is updated in the address book.
10. The filtered list is updated to show all persons.
11. The updated address book is saved to storage.

### Find member feature

The find member feature allows users to search for members by keywords across all fields.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for finding members:

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find` Command" />

How the `find` command works:
1. When the user enters a `find` command with keywords, `LogicManager` passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
2. `AddressBookParser` creates a `FindCommandParser` to parse the command arguments.
3. `FindCommandParser` splits the input into keywords.
4. A `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate` is created with the keywords.
5. A `FindCommand` object is created and executed.
6. `FindCommand` updates the filtered person list with the predicate.
7. The predicate tests each person to see if their fields contain all the keywords (case-insensitive).
8. Only persons matching all keywords are shown in the filtered list.
9. The result message shows how many persons match the criteria.

### Add event feature

The add event feature allows users to create new events with an event ID, date, and description.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for adding an event:

<puml src="diagrams/AddEventSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `addevent` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddEventCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `addevent` command works:
1. When the user enters an `addevent` command, `LogicManager` passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
2. `AddressBookParser` creates an `AddEventCommandParser` to parse the command arguments.
3. `AddEventCommandParser` validates and parses the event ID, date, and description.
4. An `AddEventCommand` object is created and executed.
5. Before execution, the current state is committed for undo/redo functionality.
6. `AddEventCommand` checks if an event with the same ID already exists.
7. If not duplicate, the event is added to the address book.
8. The updated address book is saved to storage.

### Attendance feature

The attendance feature allows users add and record which members attended specific events.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how attendance is added for an event:

<puml src="diagrams/AttendanceSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" alt="Sequence Diagram for Adding Attendance" />

The activity diagram below summarizes the flow when adding attendance:

<puml src="diagrams/AttendanceActivity.puml" width="500" alt="Activity Diagram for Adding Attendance" />

How the attendance feature works:
1. When the user enters an `addattendance` command with an event ID and member names, `LogicManager` passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
2. `AddressBookParser` creates an `AddAttendanceCommandParser` to parse the command arguments.
3. An `AddAttendanceCommand` object is created.
4. Before execution, the current state is committed for undo/redo functionality (in `LogicManager#execute()`).
5. `AddAttendanceCommand` retrieves the event by event ID from the model.
6. For each member name, it checks if the member exists and if attendance hasn't already been recorded.
7. Duplicate entries are ignored.
8. New `Attendance` objects are created and added to the event.
9. A success message is built showing which members were added and which were duplicates.
10. The updated address book is saved to storage.

*Other attendance related features (`markattendance`, `unmarkattendance`, `removeAttendees`) work in a similar way and are also undoable.*

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

## Target User Profile

**Primary User:**
CCA secretary in NUS, who needs to:
- Manage 50+ contacts of members with different roles in a structured way.
- Keep track of members’ preferences and dietary restrictions.
- Record event attendees and mark attendance.
- Delegate and track tasks.

**Pain Points:**
- **Fragmented systems:** Currently uses spreadsheets, group chats, and manual checklists, which are error-prone and time-consuming.
- **Repetitive tasks:** Re-entering the same member details across multiple files and attendance sheets.
- **Lack of structure:** Hard to filter/search members quickly (e.g., “all Year 1 members who are vegetarian”).


## Value Proposition

A streamlined address book that organises member details, tracks unique preferences, and simplifies event attendance — helping secretaries stay efficient, accurate, and focused on building stronger communities.
